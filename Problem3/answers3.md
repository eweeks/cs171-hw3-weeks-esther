##Problem 3 - Questions

###1. Name the HTML element (type and class) that represents the interactive area:
	The rect with a class of background sets the area that can be interacted with. This
	is the area that the viewer can click and drag to make the selection.

###2. Name the HTML element (type and class) that is used for representing the selection:
	 The rect with a class of extent represents the area that is selected. 

###3. What are the other DOM elements for? 
	There is also a g with a class of resize e, and a g with a class of resize w.
	Both of these contain a addition rect. The g with the class of resize e, allows
	the width of the selection(the rect with the class of extent) to be resized to the
	right of the screen. The g with a class of resize w, allows the same, but with
	resizing to the left.
